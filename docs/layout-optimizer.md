# Layout optimizer: where the space goes, and how to optimise it

The aim: layouts that use space as well as they use throughput, like a perfect
game of Tetris. This note measures where today's generators spend their tiles
(`python -m tools.bp density`), names what's structurally wasteful, and proposes
how to optimise it. Nothing here is built yet.

All numbers are from `gen NAME ... --validate` on Factorio 2.1.23 (flow tests,
and chain tests for books, all passing) and `bp density` on the result. Empty
means plain geometry: tiles inside the bounding box that no entity covers. An
empty tile inside a pole's supply area or an inserter's reach may still be doing
work, but it's space all the same.

A book's area is the sum of its rows. `production` and `factory` with the same
parameters make the same rows, so the comparison isolates the connections:
**a factory takes 6.0 to 7.2 times its rows' own area** (electronic circuits at
5/s: 260 tiles of rows, 1,560 connected).

## Where the space goes

**Rows are already tight (3 to 21% empty, 34% for sulfuric acid).** Per-column
coverage shows where their empty tiles are:

- **Assembly rows** (`in2 | in1 | ins | machine | out | product | out | machine | ins | in1 | in2`): belts and machines fill their columns (75 to 100%); the waste is in the inserter columns. A 3-tall machine with one output inserter leaves 2 of its 3 column tiles empty: the product-side output columns run 25 to 50% full (12 of 24 for 12 gear assemblers). Poles already take some of the leftover tiles.
- **Smelting columns:** the same shape. Output columns 33 to 50% full, input columns 50 to 62% (with the poles).
- **Fluid rows:** 3 to 10% empty; the shared middle pipe and both item belts run nearly full.
- **Fluid blocks:** 14 to 34% empty, and pipes are the largest single use (42 of 115 covered tiles for sulfuric acid, 137 of 239 for advanced oil processing): a main line per fluid on each side, risers to each machine, and pipe-to-ground pairs under the nearer lines. Belts every second machine add mostly-empty columns (29 to 43% full).

**Factories are not (54 to 65% empty), and that's the connections.** For
electronic circuits at 5/s (20 x 78 tiles):

- The bus columns run 21 to 85% full: lines start at the bottom and end at their last user, so the columns are ragged and the box around them holds the empty rest.
- Every row hands its products back west to the bus through a corridor, with two empty rows between corridor jobs so crossing lines can come back up.
- Rows are stacked north in one column, so the factory is as tall as all its rows plus all its corridors, and as wide as the widest row plus the bus.

## What's structurally wasteful, and what's a cost to keep

| Waste | Where | Size |
|---|---|---|
| Products return to the bus instead of feeding the next row directly | factory | the bulk of 5 to 6 times the rows' area |
| Rows stacked in one column, each as wide as its own template | factory | ragged east edge, bus as tall as the factory |
| Ragged bus columns | factory | 21 to 85% column fill |
| Two empty rows between corridor jobs (for undergrounds to resurface) | factory | 2 rows per crossing |
| One output inserter per 3-tall machine column | rows | 2 empty tiles per machine per side |
| A main line per fluid on both sides of a fluid block | fluid_block | pipes 37 to 57% of covered tiles |
| No inserter research assumed | all rows | more inserters and slower machines than a researched player needs |

The last one also caused the audit's only refusal: processing units in
assembling machine 3 need 4 inserters a side where 3 fit, measured without
research (`tools/inserter_rates.json`). `production` falls back to assembling
machine 2 for that row on its own; `fluid_row` asked directly refuses with "try a
slower machine". With inserter capacity research (#38 measured
`inserter-capacity-bonus` 7 tripling a fast inserter's hand), the faster machine
fits and the row needs fewer of them. A `research=` option on the row generators
would make every row smaller, but it's a capability change with its own flow
tests, not part of the optimiser.

## How to optimise space

Two problems, at two scales.

### 1. The factory: floorplanning plus routing (the big gain)

- **Decision variables.** For each row: which variant (sides 1 or 2, machine count split, mirrored), and its position on the tile grid (x, y integers) and orientation (north or south flow). For each connection between a producer's output and a consumer's input: a belt route on the grid (or a pipe route for fluids), its lane, and where it goes underground.
- **Hard constraints.**
  - Rows don't overlap (each row is a rectangle from its template).
  - Every connection is a continuous belt or pipe path, entering inputs at the template's input ports and leaving at its output ports.
  - Belt lanes as the rows need them: two ingredients on one belt by side-loading, as `factory.py` does today.
  - Pipe networks never touch unless they carry the same fluid, and none is longer than 320 tiles without a pump (NOTES).
  - Underground belts and pipe-to-ground within their reach (4 to 10 tiles by tier), never under something they can't pass.
  - Poles cover every powered entity and every pole is within wire reach of another.
  - Throughput: each connection carries its flow within a belt's or pipe's measured capacity, and the whole layout meets its target rate in `flow_tests` in game. That stays the final judge.
- **Objective,** lexicographic: bounding-box area first, then empty tiles, then entity count (fewer belts and undergrounds).
- **Solver.** A two-level search, each level the tool it suits:
  1. **Floorplan with CP-SAT** (`ortools`). Rows as fixed-size rectangles (one interval variable per axis per row, `AddNoOverlap2D`), with optional variants as alternatives. Minimise box area plus a weighted estimate of connection length (Manhattan distance between ports, times flow). This is exactly what CP-SAT is good at, with tens of rows, and it proves optimality or reports the gap.
  2. **Route with a deterministic grid router** (A* over tiles, with underground moves as edges of the right length, lanes assigned by the rules `factory.py` already encodes). A floorplan the router can't connect is cut, and the floorplan is solved again.
  3. **Validate in game** with the factory's own flow test. Only layouts that meet the target rate count.
- **Is `ortools` worth adding?** Yes for the floorplan. Writing an exact rectangle packer with alternatives and a proof of optimality by hand would reinvent CP-SAT badly. It's one pip install (wheels for macOS arm64 and Linux x64), used only by the optimiser, so the rest of the app doesn't depend on it. Not for routing: a CP-SAT routing model on a grid this size gets large, and a grid router with rip-up and reroute is the standard tool.
- **Start cheaper.** Before any solver, try a constructive layout: rows ordered by the recipe graph, each consumer placed beside its producer with the product belt handed over directly, the bus kept only for raw inputs. Measure it with `bp density` against today's factory. If that captures most of the gain, the solver is for the last stretch; if not, it's needed from the start.

### 2. Rows: templates are already near their own optimum (a small gain)

Rows are a fixed column template repeated per machine, so their search space is
small and enumerable: inserter tier and count per side, pole positions, whether
the second input belt is needed. Exact enumeration over the template (no solver)
can find the smallest row that passes its flow test. The ceiling is the 3 to 21%
empty, and most of that is inserter-column tiles a 3-tall machine can't avoid.

## Recommendation

- **First target: `factory`.** It holds 83 to 86% of a connected factory's area outside its rows, against at most 21% inside a row.
- **First step: the constructive layout above,** measured with `bp density` and validated with the factory's flow test, to size the gain before adding `ortools`.
- **Expected gain, untested.** If the connections took as much area as the rows instead of 5 to 6 times as much, electronic circuits at 5/s would go from 1,560 tiles to about 520: three times smaller. That's an estimate from the measurements above, not a result.
- **Alongside: a `research=` option for inserter capacity on the row generators.** It shrinks every row and lifts the processing-unit refusal.
